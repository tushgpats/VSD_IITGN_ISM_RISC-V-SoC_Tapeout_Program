## Background behind emergence of SoCs ##
<br></br>

For much of the Second half of the century, the Central Processing Unit (CPU) was designed as a standalone chip responsible only for executing instructions. In order to build a 
complete system, this CPU had to be connected to several external peripherals such as memory chips (RAM and ROM), timers, counters, and I/O controllers. All of these components were 
mounted on a printed circuit board and linked together using data, address, and control buses. 
In the earliest days of computing, from the 1950s through the 1970s, the CPU was treated as a standalone unit. Early machines used boards or even cabinets full of discrete logic. Even 
when the microprocessor arrived in the 1970s with chips like Intel’s 4004 (1971), 8080 (1974), and Motorola’s 6800 (1974), the idea still stayed the same.

<h4> While this approach worked, it had significant drawbacks, including larger board area, higher power consumption, longer interconnect delays, and increased cost since multiple chips had to be manufactured, packaged, and tested separately.</h4>
