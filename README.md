# VSD_IITGN_ISM_RISC-V-SoC_Tapeout_Program
This program is an joint initiative Between VSD and IIT-Gandginagar and supported by SCL chandigarh and C2S program of Misistry of Electronics and IT. This Program aims to takes 
participants through the full journey of SoC design, from RTL to GDSII, using open-source as well as Industry standard EDA tools.

Now before we dig deep, let us dive deep into the significance of Semiconductors and Opensource Tools and Open Standard specifications.

The global semiconductor market was valued at over USD 681 billion in 2024 and is projected to exceed USD 2 trillion by 2032, growing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 
roughly 15.4%. Key growth drivers include the expanding use of semiconductors in areas like AI, cloud computing, and 5G technology, with the Asia Pacific region holding the largest 
market share. 

India's semiconductor consumption market was USD 52 billion in 2024-25 and is projected to reach USD 103.4 billion by 2030 with a CAGR of Approximately 13%., 
driven by surging domestic demand in sectors like mobile, IT, and industrial applications.
